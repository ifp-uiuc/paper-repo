# Description
This paper presents a multi-scale object detector using a convolutional neural network. The algorithm uses a slidling window approach over multiple scales and then uses a greedy merging scheme to suppress false detection and select the most confident response. This work achieved state-of-the-art results on the imageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2013 (ILSVRC2013).
